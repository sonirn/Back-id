## 🔄 CURRENT PHASE

### Phase 2: AI Analysis & Planning (✅ 85% Complete)
**Status**: Major blockers resolved, text-only analysis working

#### ✅ Completed in Phase 2:
- Gemini API integration with multi-layered fallback approach
- Official Google Generative AI library integration  
- Emergentintegrations library fallback
- Text-only video analysis (working solution)
- Video analysis pipeline with comprehensive error handling
- Plan generation system with JSON parsing
- Plan modification endpoints
- Multiple API key rotation system
- API quota management and failover

#### ✅ Recent Fixes:
- **RESOLVED**: Gemini API integration now working with text-only approach

## 🔑 API KEYS STATUS

### ✅ Working APIs:
- **Cloudflare R2**: Configured and tested ✅
- **MongoDB**: Connected and working ✅
- **Gemini API**: 3 keys working with text-only analysis ✅

### ⚠️ APIs to Test:
- **GROQ API**: Provided, not tested yet
- **ElevenLabs**: Provided, not integrated yet

### 🔧 APIs with Issues:
- **Gemini File Upload**: Official library and emergentintegrations failing with file processing, but text-only working ✅

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### 1. WAN 2.1 Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video generation model not implemented
**Impact**: Core functionality missing
**Solution**: Research and implement WAN 2.1 open source deployment

### 2. FFmpeg Integration (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video processing pipeline missing
**Impact**: Cannot create final 9:16 videos
**Solution**: Implement FFmpeg for video combining and effects

### 3. Gemini File Upload (MEDIUM - WORKAROUND EXISTS)
**Issue**: File upload processing failing in both libraries
**Impact**: Cannot analyze actual video files
**Solution**: Text-only analysis working, implement file metadata extraction
**Status**: ✅ Working workaround implemented
