## üîë API KEYS STATUS

### ‚úÖ Working APIs:
- **Cloudflare R2**: Configured and tested ‚úÖ
- **MongoDB**: Connected and working ‚úÖ
- **Gemini API**: 3 keys working with text-only analysis ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è APIs to Test:
- **GROQ API**: Provided, not tested yet
- **ElevenLabs**: Provided, not integrated yet

### üîß APIs with Issues:
- **Gemini File Upload**: Official library and emergentintegrations failing with file processing, but text-only working ‚úÖ

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### 1. WAN 2.1 Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video generation model not implemented
**Impact**: Core functionality missing
**Solution**: Research and implement WAN 2.1 open source deployment

### 2. FFmpeg Integration (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video processing pipeline missing
**Impact**: Cannot create final 9:16 videos
**Solution**: Implement FFmpeg for video combining and effects

### 3. Gemini File Upload (MEDIUM - WORKAROUND EXISTS)
**Issue**: File upload processing failing in both libraries
**Impact**: Cannot analyze actual video files
**Solution**: Text-only analysis working, implement file metadata extraction
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working workaround implemented
