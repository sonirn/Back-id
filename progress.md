## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS

### 1. WAN 2.1 Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video generation model not implemented
**Impact**: Core functionality missing
**Solution**: Research and implement WAN 2.1 open source deployment

### 2. FFmpeg Integration (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Video processing pipeline missing
**Impact**: Cannot create final 9:16 videos
**Solution**: Implement FFmpeg for video combining and effects

### 3. Gemini File Upload (MEDIUM - WORKAROUND EXISTS)
**Issue**: File upload processing failing in both libraries
**Impact**: Cannot analyze actual video files
**Solution**: Text-only analysis working, implement file metadata extraction
**Status**: ‚úÖ Working workaround implemented
